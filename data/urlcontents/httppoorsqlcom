Poor SQL - Instant Free and Open-Source T-SQL Formatting 
 

 
	 Poor SQL :  Take pity on your SQL with instant, 
	free and open-source, online or offline formatting using the 
	 Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter  
	library. If you like it, download the 
	 SSMS / Visual Studio plugin , 
	the  command-line bulk formatter , 
	and/or the  WinMerge plugin  
	to integrate it into your workflow - equally free. (Or if you're feeling cruel, obfuscate your SQL instead!)  
    NEW: Now use poorsql.com regardless of whether you're connected to the internet - it now automatically works offline!
