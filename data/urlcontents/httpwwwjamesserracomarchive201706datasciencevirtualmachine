			     The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) is a customized VM image on Microsoft’s Azure cloud built specifically for doing data science.  It has many popular data science and other tools pre-installed and pre-configured to jump-start building intelligent applications for advanced analytics.  So instead of you having to create a VM and download and install all these tools which can take many hours, within a matter of minutes you can be up and running.
