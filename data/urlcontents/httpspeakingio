   Thoughts on public speaking by  Zach Holman 
 
     Public speaking is tough. 
     
      Be it at a conference, or during a company meeting, or in your car trying
      to persuade the cop not to ticket you for going three times the speed
      limit while streaming an episode of  The Maury Povich Show  on your
      iPad, talking in front of other people can be an intimidating experience.

          I'm  Zach Holman . I've
           spoken  at more technical
          conferences than anyone else on the planet, aside from those who have
          spoken at more conferences than me.
