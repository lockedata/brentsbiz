SQL Server - estimates outside of the histogram - half-baked draft
 
 
 
 
 
 Gonna pull together lots of stuff about cardinality estimates outside of the stats histogram here.  It'll take me a while...     SQL  Server keeps track of how many inserts and deletes since last stats  update – when the number of inserts/deletes exceeds the stats update  threshold the next time a query requests those stats it’ll qualify for  an update.  Trace flag 2371 alters the threshold
