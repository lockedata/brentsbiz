			 Welcome to SQL Slack. 
 This is one of the places where the SQL Server community gets together and talks online. 
 Slack is a totally free platform where you sign up for communities (like this one), and then you can join specific channels like: 
 #SQLhelp  and  #PowerShellHelp  – very active places to get help 
 #DBAtools  – help &amp; development discussions for  DBAtools.io , a popular open source PowerShell management tool 
 #FirstResponderKit  – questions and dev discussions about sp_Blitz and friends 
 That’s why some folks like it better than open forums like Twitter or Facebook – you can just join the channels you want, and only see things that are devoted to your favorite topics.
