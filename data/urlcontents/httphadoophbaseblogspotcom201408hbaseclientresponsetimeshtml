HBase client response times
 
 
 
 
 
 By Lars Hofhansl 
When talking about latency expectations from HBase you'll hear various anecdotes and various war- and horror-stories where latency varies from a few milliseconds to many minutes. 
In this blog post I will classify the latency conditions and their causes. 
There are five principle causes to latency in HBase: Normal  network round trip time (RTT) plus internal work that HBase has to do to retrieve or write the data. This type of latency is in the order of  milliseconds  - RTT + disk seeks, etc.
