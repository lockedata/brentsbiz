			 As a solo developer, I decided to offer phone support, and this is what happened 
			 
		 This year, around February, I started offering telephone support for  Taxnote , which I hadn’t done up until then, because the idea made me anxious. 
 I intended to quit if, at any time, I thought it was tough for me to do; but, so far, I have continued with it for over half a year, so I’ll update you on the things I’ve learned from doing it. 
 I wrote my phone number in the help section of the Japanese version only, since I live in Japan and it is a JP number. I might try it in English too in the future, if I can make it work with an international calling facility like Skype.
