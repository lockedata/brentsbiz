		 SQL Filegroup/File Proportional Fill Algorithm

			 I had a question at work recently where there was some confusion around how SQL Server allocates data across  data files  within a  filegroup  in a  user database .  There was a mention that data was  not being distributed evenly  across files and also that a  trace flag  was needed for SQL Server to distribute data evenly.  I am uncertain if those circumstances were database config related or something else outside of proportional fill.
