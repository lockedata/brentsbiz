   I’m proud and excited to share that Kaggle is joining Google Cloud! 
 Seven years ago, we launched our first ever competition, to predict the voting patterns for the Eurovision Song Contest.   It was won by  Jure Zbontar , who beat 21 teams to win the $1000 prize.  
 Since then, the Kaggle community has used machine learning to  grade high school essays ,  diagnose heart failure  and  increase the discovery significance of the Higgs Boson . Geoff Hint
