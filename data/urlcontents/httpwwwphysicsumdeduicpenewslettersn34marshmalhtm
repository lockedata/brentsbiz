 I have heard that at 16 years old, Albert Einstein constantly
wondered what it would be like to ride on a beam of light. Students in
physics always seem to be fascinated by the properties of light. However,
speed-of-light demonstrations often require extensive preparation or expensive
equipment. I have prepared a simple classroom demonstration that the students
