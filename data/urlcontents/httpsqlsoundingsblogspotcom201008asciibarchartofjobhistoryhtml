 ASCII Bar Chart of Job History 
 
 
 
 If you're like me, it's a lot easier to understand things with a picture.  With that in mind, here's a script you can run as a Job which will print out a visual representation of the Jobs that ran in the last 24 hours.  The results are emailed to whatever address you provide (near the end of the script). 

 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 -- Prints a primitive bar chart that shows all the jobs that ran during the     
 -- last 24 hours.  Useful for visualizing overlap.
