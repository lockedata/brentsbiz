 Original Twitter homepage

 Or at least a very early version. From humble beginnings… 

 ps.  Here’s an early Facebook screenshot ,  an early Google homepage , and  Yahoo’s homepage circa 1994 , and  an early screencap of Tumblr’s dashboard . 

 Update:  If you look at the screenshot closely, there’s a familiar name at the top of the “What your friends…” box: Instagram co-founder  Kevin Systrom  (his Twitter user id is 380…meaning that he was one of the first 400 people to sign up for the service).
