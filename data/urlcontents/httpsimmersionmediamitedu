 Once you log in, Immersion will use only the From, To, Cc and Timestamp fields of the emails in the account you are signing in with. It will not access the subject or the body content of any of your emails.
 

 Upon logging out of Immersion, you will be presented with a choice to save or delete your data, which contains your compressed email metadata and user profile. 
 
 
 If you decide to save your email metadata with Immersion, that data will be stored in a secure system. You can always return to the site remotely and delete it at a later time, if you wish to do so. 
 If you take a snapshot of your Immersion network, the snapshot link will be accessible for 30 days, after which it will be deleted from our server. Frequently Asked Questions
