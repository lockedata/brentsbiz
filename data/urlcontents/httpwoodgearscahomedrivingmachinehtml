Having had success with my  
baby rocking machine , I had another idea for a baby calming machine.
 
Our baby Harriet really likes car rides and stroller rides, so I was thinking
of a machine to simulate that.  Ideally, with some slow turning bumpy
cams to make for irregular motion.  My next thought was to make something that
slowly pulls the stroller across a bumpy lawn, and from that, figured, why not
some sort of motorized carriage to drive the baby in circles on the lawn?
 
A windshield wiper motor might be ideal for that, but I didn't have one at hand.
My next idea was to use an old cordless drill (batteries long expired)
and gear it down with wooden gears.  Here, my design for the final reduction
to the wheels (with my  gear program , of course).
 
 
 
But then it occurred to me that I could just reuse some gears I made earlier.
