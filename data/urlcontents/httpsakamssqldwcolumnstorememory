						 Rowgroup quality is determined by the number of rows in a rowgroup. Reduce memory requirements or increase the available memory to maximize the number of rows a columnstore index compresses into each rowgroup.  Use these methods to improve compression rates and query performance for columnstore indexes. 
 Why the rowgroup size matters 
 Since a columnstore index scans a table by scanning column segments of individual rowgroups, maximizing the number of rows in each rowgroup enhances query performance. When rowgroups have a high number of rows, data compression impr
