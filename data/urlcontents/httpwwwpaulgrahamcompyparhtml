people: that you could get smarter programmers to work on
a Python project than you could to work on a Java project. I didn't mean by this that Java programmers are dumb.  I
meant that Python programmers are smart. It's a lot of
work to learn a new programming language.  And people don't
learn Python because it will get them a job; they learn it
because they genuinely like to program and aren't satisfied with the languages they
already know. Which makes them exactly the kind of programmers
companies should want to hire.  Hence what, for lack of a better
name, I'll call the Python paradox: if a company chooses to write
its software in a comparatively esoteric language, they'll be able 
to hire better programmers, because they'll attract only those
who cared enough to learn it.  And for 
programmers the paradox is even more pronounced: the language
to learn, if you want to get a good job, is a language
