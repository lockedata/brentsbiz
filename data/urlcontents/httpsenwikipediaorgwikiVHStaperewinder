A rewinder for VHS tapes 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 In addition to  Beta tape  rewinders, [1]  these devices were created shortly after the production of videotapes and were used because  VCRs  were believed to make kinks in the tapes which could corrupt playback after several rewinds. Video rental stores like  Blockbuster  charged a fee for not rewinding VHS tapes when returning, and had slogans like 'Be kind, rewind'. The rewinder would rewind tapes smoothly and additionally be several times faster. Using them would also prevent wear and tear on the heads of the VHS itself, and allowed you to watch the next tape immediately after. [2] [3]
