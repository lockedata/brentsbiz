		 In case you don’t know, this query: 

		 
		
			 
			 Transact-SQL 
			 
			 
UPDATE dbo.Test1
SET C2 = 2
WHERE C1 LIKE '%33%'; 
			 
				 
					 1 2 3 
				 
						 UPDATE   dbo . Test1 SET   C2   =   2 WHERE   C1   LIKE   '%33%' ; 
					 
		 
 
 Will run quite a bit slower than this query: 

		 
		
			 
			 Transact-SQL 
			 
			 
UPDATE dbo.Test1
SET C2 = 1
WHERE C1 LIKE '333%'; 
			 
				 
					 1 2 3 
				 
						 UPDATE   dbo . Test1 SET   C2   =   1 WHERE   C1   LIKE   '333%' ; 
					 
		 
 
 Or this on
