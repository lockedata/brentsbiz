 Troubleshooting Database Mirroring Error 1418 
 Error 1418 is a common, hard-to-troubleshoot error. It is so common that it has been given its own page dedicated to the error in Books Online:  MSSQLSERVER_1418 . Unfortunately, that page only lists a few troubleshooting steps. Over the years, I’ve compiled a longer list of troubleshooting steps for this error. I’ve encountered every one of these issues at some point.
