   9.24. Set Returning Functions 
   This section describes functions that possibly return more
  than one row. The most widely used functions in this class are
  series generating functions, as detailed in  Table 9-54  and
   Table
  9-55 . Other, more specialized set-returning functions are
  described elsewhere in this manual. See
