	 Don’t like much really, do I? 
But what I do like I love passionately. 
 Bit obscene 
 One question I get asked a lot is how I got started with SQL Server. 
 The short version is that one day I got mad about doing a VLOOKUP in Excel, and my boss at the time told me I should do it in SQL. 
 The longer version is a bit more involved, of course. 
 I had always loved computers. My mom was a 2nd grade teacher, and would get old computers from her school (Apple II and II GS were some of my earliest memories). 
 Not that I ever did anything like programming on them — I was just a consumer of the entertainment and a user of the word process
