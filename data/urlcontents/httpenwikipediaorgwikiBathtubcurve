The 'bathtub curve' hazard function (blue, upper solid line) is a combination of a decreasing hazard of early failure (red dotted line) and an increasing hazard of wear-out failure (yellow dotted line), plus some constant hazard of random failure (green, lower solid line). 
 
 
 The  bathtub curve  is widely used in  reliability engineering . It describes a particular form of the  hazard function  which comprises three parts: 
 The first part is a decreasing  failure rate , known as early  failures . 
 The second part is a constant failure rate, known as  random  failures. 
 The third part is an increasing failure rate, known as wear-out failures. 
 The name is derived from the cross-sectional shape of a  bathtub : steep sides and a flat bottom. 
 The bathtub curve is generated by mapping the rat
