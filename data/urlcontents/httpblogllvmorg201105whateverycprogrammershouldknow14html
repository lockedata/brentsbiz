 What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior #2/3 
 
 
 
In  Part 1  of our series, we discussed what undefined behavior is, and how it allows C and C++ compilers to produce higher performance applications than "safe" languages.  This post talks about how "unsafe" C really is, explaining some of the highly surprising effects that undefined behavior can cause.  In  Part #3 , we talk about what friendly compilers can do to mitigate some of the surprise, even if they aren't required to.  
I like to call this " Why undefined behavior is often a scary and terrible thing for C programmers ". :-)
