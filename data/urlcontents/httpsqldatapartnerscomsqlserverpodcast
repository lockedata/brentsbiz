					 The SQL Data Partners Podcast 
 In this SQL Server podcast, Steve Stedman and Carlos L Chacon discuss a variety of SQL Server related topics mixed with a sprinkling of professional development.  We want to introduce new and familiar topics and talk about them in a way you may have not considered.  We are all on different stages as data professionals, and we can all something new.  We hope you will join us on the SQL trail compañeros–you won’t regret it.
