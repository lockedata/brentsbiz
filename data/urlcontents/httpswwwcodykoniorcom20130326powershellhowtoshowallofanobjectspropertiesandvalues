 I was scratching my head looking at a complex .NET object and wondering how to get all of the values out of it. For example: 
 $date   =   New-Object  System.DateTime
 $date  |  Write-Host   # Because I was doing it remotely in a job 
 
 Monday, 1 January 0001 12:00:00 AM
 
 And yet there are so many more properties available on the object: 
 $date  |  Get-Member 
 
 TypeName: System.DateTime
# ... Snipped for brevity
Date                 Property       datetime Date {get;}
Day                  Property       int Day {get;}
DayOfWeek            Property       System.DayOfWeek DayOfWe
