				 This is a  list of Ig Nobel Prize winners  from 1991 to the present day. 
 A  parody  of the  Nobel Prizes , the  Ig Nobel Prizes  are awarded each year in mid-September, around the time the recipients of the genuine Nobel Prizes are announced, for ten achievements that "first make people laugh, and then make them think". Commenting on the 2006 awards,  Marc Abrahams , editor of  Annals of Improbable Research  and co-sponsor of the awards, said that "[t]he prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honor the imaginative, and spur people's interest in science, medicine, and technology". [1]  All prizes are awarded for real achievements, except for three in 1991 and one in 1994, due to an erroneous press release.
