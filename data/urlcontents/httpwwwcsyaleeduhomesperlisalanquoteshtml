 EPIGRAMS IN PROGRAMMING 
 
 
1. One man's constant is another man's variable.
 
2. Functions delay binding; data structures induce binding.
Moral: Structure data late in the programming process.
 
3. Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon.
 
4. Every program is a part of some other program and rarely
fits.
 
5. If a program manipulates a large amount of data, it does
so in a small number of ways.
 
6. Symmetry is a complexity-reducing concept (co-routines
include subroutines); seek it everywhere.
 
7. It is easier to write an incorrect program than
understand a correct one.
 
8. A programming language is low level when its programs
require attention to the irrelevant.
 
9. It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data
structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.
 
10. Get into a rut early: Do the same process the same way.
Accumulate idioms. Standardize. The only difference(!)
