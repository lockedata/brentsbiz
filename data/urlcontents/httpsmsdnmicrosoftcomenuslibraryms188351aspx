This object can be a table, index, column, alias data type, or  Microsoft  .NET Framework common language runtime (CLR) user-defined type.   
 Caution  Changing any part of an object name can break scripts and stored procedures. We recommend you do not use this statement to rename stored procedures, triggers, user-defined functions, or views; instead, drop the object and re-create it with the new name.
