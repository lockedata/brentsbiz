 About the Multitenant Architecture 
 
 The  multitenant architecture  enables an Oracle database to function as a multitenant container database (CDB). 
 A  CDB  includes zero, one, or many customer-created pluggable databases (PDBs). A  PDB  is a portable collection of schemas, schema objects, and nonschema objects that appears to an Oracle Net client as a  non-CDB . All Oracle databases before Oracle Database 12 c  were non-CDBs.
