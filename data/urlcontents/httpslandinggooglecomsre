          What is SRE?
         
         
          SRE is what you get when you treat operations as if it’s a software problem. Our mission
          is to protect, provide for, and progress the software and systems behind all of Google’s
          public services — Google Search, Ads, Gmail, Android, YouTube, and AppEngine, to name
          just a few — with an ever-watchful eye on their availability, latency, performance, and
          capacity.
