    				Columnstore    			 
  			 
    			 I am deeply fascinated by the Columnstore Indexes, and I have open some Connect Items to suggest their important improvements: 
–  Implement Batch Mode Support for Row Store 
–  Multi-threaded rebuilds of Clustered Columnstore Indexes break the sequence of pre-sorted segment ordering (Order Clustering) 
–  Columnstore Segments Maintenance – Remove &amp; Merge Implement Computed Columns for Clustered Columnstore Indexes 
 Scripts Library: 
I am publishing  CSIL – Columnstore Indexes Script Library , with the first release targeting the 1st of September 2015. Sign up
