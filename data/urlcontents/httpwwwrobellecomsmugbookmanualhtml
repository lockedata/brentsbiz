 How to Read a Manual 
 By Alfredo Rego

 What follows is Alfredo's answer to a question from
the audience at a RUG meeting.  The question was:
"Do you have the IMAGE  hashing  algorithm?" Alfredo
detected the question behind the question and made
this reply. 
 
 You should read manuals like you read love letters.
 
In a love letter,  everything counts .
You read between the lines, above the lines, below the
lines, and in the margins.  You read between the
individual letters (is that "i" dotted in an
angry way?) You wonder what significance the stamp has.
You smell the envelope for any special fragrance. You
study the salutation (why "dearest" and
not "darling" this time?)
 

You even try to take the sheets of paper apart!
 

In a manual, everything counts as well.  Your heart may
not pound as strongly when you read a manual. But you will
certainly have more time for love if you do not have to
spend endless hour
