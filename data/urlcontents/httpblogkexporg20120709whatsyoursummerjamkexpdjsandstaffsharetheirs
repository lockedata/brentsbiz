 Seattle can now claim a hold on summer as we reach post-80 degree weather this week! (Sorry, rest of the country, but we’ve earned this!) No matter where you are, though, or whether you’re sitting out on the beach, picnicking in a park, heading out on a long roadtrip or just chilling at home, you’re going to want to soundtrack these hot summer days with some hot new jams. To help beef up your playlists, we’ve asked KEXP DJs and staff what’s in their heavy rotation this summer. Comment below and let us know what your summer jam is!
