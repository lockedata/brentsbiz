Off-the-shelf  Red Cross  preparedness kit 
 
 
 A  bug-out bag  or  BOB [1] [2]  is a portable kit that normally contains the items one would require to survive for 72 hours [3] [4]  when evacuating from a  disaster , although some kits are designed to last longer periods. Other names for such a bag are a  BOB , [5] 72-hour kit , [6]  a  grab bag ,  battle box ,  personal emergency relocation kit  (PERK),  go bag ,  GOOD bag  (get out of Dodge), [7] INCH bag  (I'm never coming home). [8]  or  quick run bag  (QRB). [9] [10] 
 The focus is on  evacuation , rather than long-term  survival , distinguishing the bug-out bag from a  survival kit , a boating or aviation emergency kit, or a fixed-site disaster supplies kit. The kits are also popular in the  survivalism  and  prepper  subcultures. [11]
