   I joined the ad server team at  AppNexus 
two weeks ago.  It’s a new problem domain for me, one that I find
pretty interesting so far: the workload is definitely on the
branchy/pointer-chasing side of things, and, although aggregate
throughput matters, we work under stringent latency goals.  There are
a few hash table lookups on the code path I’ve been working on, and
some micro-benchmarking revealed that 1GB pages could easily shave 25%
off the latency for lookups in large (hundreds of MB) tables. 

 That’s not too surprising.  Given any change, it’s usually easy to
design a situation that makes it shine.  I find it just as important to
ask the opposite question: what’s the worst slowdow
