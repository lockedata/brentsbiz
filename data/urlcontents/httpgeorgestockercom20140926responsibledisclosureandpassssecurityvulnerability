		 I’ve only been at the DBA thing for the last six months. I’m as close to an Accidental DBA as it gets; and I’m the first to admit that. I’m learning fast, I’m learning on the Job, and (full disclosure),  the Brent Ozar Unlimited team has helped with that , tremendously. 
 I’ve been following  Brent Ozar ‘s blog for a long time now, and more recently started paying attention to the  PASS debacle(s) . Before, it was idle curiousity, now it’s because I’m working day in and day out in that sphere. I can’t afford to be ignorant.
