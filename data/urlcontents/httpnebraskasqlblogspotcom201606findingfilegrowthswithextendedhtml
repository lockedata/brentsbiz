Finding File Growths with Extended Events
 
 
 
 
 
I give a SQLSaturday session called "Introduction to Extended Events" and at a recent presentation I had a pair of attendees ask me afterwards for a more "real world" example. Â I had a basic demo in my session showing setting up a session with a predicate filter to pull particular events for a single database, but it didn't really show using XEvents to solve a business problem.
