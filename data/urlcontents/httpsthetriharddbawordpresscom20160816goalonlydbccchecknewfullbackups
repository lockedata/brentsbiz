		 In my previous  post  I had the goal of taking my network backups and looking at all of the FULL backups and saving that info to a table then to restore it, run a dbcc checkdb on it, then drop the database. 
 This time my goal is to only look at the newest FULL backups. 
 I was successful in doing this just had to add a check to when I am inserting into my BackupFiles table. 
 
 
	SELECT @counter = Count(*) FROM BackupFiles where FileNamePath = @BackupFile
	If(@counter = 0)
	Begin
    --put backupfile into a table and then later work out which ones are log and full backups
		INSERT INTO BackupFiles (FileNamePath, dbname) VALUES(@BackupFile, @BackupDirectory)
		--pr
