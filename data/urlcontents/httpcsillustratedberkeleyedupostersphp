CS Illustrated: the Posters 
 
Here you will find illustrations sized for printing as posters. Again, they are grouped by the course(s) they cover.  
The posters are put in order from Left to Right as how they should be displayed on the wall or handouts. 
These posters can be printed to any size, provided the ratio of width to height is 2:3 (e.g. 24"x36").
