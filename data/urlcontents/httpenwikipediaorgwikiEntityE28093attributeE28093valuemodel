				 Entity–attribute–value model  ( EAV ) is a  data model  to encode, in a space-efficient manner, entities where the number of attributes (properties, parameters) that can be used to describe them is potentially vast, but the number that will actually apply to a given entity is relatively modest. Such entities correspond to the mathematical notion of a  sparse matrix . EAV is also known as  object–attribute–value model ,  vertical database model  and  open schema .
