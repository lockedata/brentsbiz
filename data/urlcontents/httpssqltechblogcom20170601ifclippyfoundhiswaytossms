					 Recently my wife and I were comparing Cortana with Siri. It’s sometimes fun to compare virtual assistants to see how well they fare. Try asking Siri: “What time is it in GMT?”. We found a lot of others that Cortana knows that Siri doesn’t. This got me thinking. What if Clippy was included in SSMS? 
 
 There are so many DBA topics that Clippy could help with. What about Security? Could Clippy help there? 
 
 I’m not sure that’s what I was looking for; but, thanks Clippy. 
 What about Coding with TS
