			 Let’s Pretend This Never Happened 
			 
				 I wrote  a book  and it only took me 11 years.   (Shut up, Stephen King.) 
 You should probably go buy it right now, because it’s filled with awesomeness.  And cocaine.  But only if you hollow it out and fill it with your own cocaine.  I’m not buying you cocaine.   Because I love you. 
 And  that’s  why you should buy my book.  Because I’m saving you from yourself.   And  from cocaine. 
 YOU’RE WELCOME. 
 It’s available at  Amazon ,  Barnes &amp; Noble ,  Indie Bound ,  Books-A-Million ,  Audible   and   iTunes   and it somehow became a   #1 NYT BestSeller the first week out .   I have no idea how that happened either.
