		 I hope you take backups or have a recovery plan in place before a SQL Server service pack upgrade,  if not you might want to reconsider. Initially I wasn’t going to capture the screen shots during this recovery because my focus was to fix the issue but I thought I would just in case others experience the same thing. 
 I wanted to move from SQL Server 2014 SP1 to SP2, as you can see I had a clear issue.
