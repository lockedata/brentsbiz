     A day in the life of a slow page at Stack Overflow

       I have been spending a fair amount of time tuning Stack Overflow, in this post I will walk through the process of tuning a single page. 
 In this post I would like to walk through our internal process of tuning a particular page on Stack Overflow. 
 In this example I will be looking at our  badge detail page . It is not the most important page on the site, however it happens to showcase quite a few issues. 
 ## #Step  1, Do we even have a problem? 
 As a developer, when I browse through the sites I can see how long a page takes to render.
