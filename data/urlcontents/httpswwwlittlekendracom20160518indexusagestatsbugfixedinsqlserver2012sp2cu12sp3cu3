 Microsoft has just released a new round of cumulative updates for SQL Server 2012, and the release notes indicate that a fix to the sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats dynamic management view has been included in these updates. This is good news for index tuners using SQL Server 2012. 
 As of SP2 + CU12 and SP3 + CU3, SQL Server 2012 will persist index usage information even when ALTER INDEX REBUILD is run. 
 What About SQL Server 2014? 
 A comment on the Connect Item on sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats says  the fix is planned to be released in the upcoming release of SQL Server 2014 SP2 . 
 What About Missing Index DMVs info? 
 These DMVs still get reset/cleared on index rebuilds.  Vote to fix this bug here .
