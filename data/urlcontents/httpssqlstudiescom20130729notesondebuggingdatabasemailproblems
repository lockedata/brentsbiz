      	 Notes on debugging Database Mail problems 
       				 7

			 I’ve had to debug database mail problems several times over the last year or so.  Below is a collection of the stored procedures and queries that I’ve ended up using.  I’ve added notes to most of them to help explain and work with them.   
 USE msdb
GO

-- Check that the service broker is enabled on MSDB. 
-- Is_broker_enabled must be 1 to use database mail.
SELECT is_broker_enabled FROM sys.databases WHE
