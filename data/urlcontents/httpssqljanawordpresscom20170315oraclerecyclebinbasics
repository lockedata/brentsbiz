		 Oracle – Recycle Bin Basics 
			 
		 As you may know, Oracle introduced this wonderful feature called “Recycle Bin” in 10g. It behaves very much like the Windows recycle bin. when an object is dropped, it does not really get physically removed. Instead, the object still resides in the same tablespace it used to. Oracle simply renames the object and maintains a reference to renamed version. 
 A simple illustration should help. 
 Create a test table: 
 
CREATE TABLE test1
AS
SELECT * FROM all_objects
WHERE rownum &lt; 100;
 
 Drop the test table 
 
DROP TABLE test1;
 
 Is it in the recycle bin? 
 
--Synonym for user_recyclebin
SELECT * FROM RECYCLEBIN;
