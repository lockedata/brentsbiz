		 Bit of fun this week with something that a colleague of mine noticed when playing around with SQL Server on linux. 
 The first thing you do when playing with a new technology is see how you can break it right? Always good fun ðŸ™‚

 Once you have your instance up and running, connect it to as normal in SSMS and create a database with one table:- 
 
CREATE DATABASE [GoingToBreak];
GO

USE [GoingToBreak];
GO

CREATE TABLE
