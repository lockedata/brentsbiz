 System request  (often abbreviated  SysRq  or  Sys Req ) is a key on  personal computer  keyboards that has no standard use. [1]  Introduced by  IBM  with the  PC/AT , it was intended to be available as a special key to directly invoke low-level  operating system  functions with no possibility of conflicting with any existing software. A special  BIOS  routine – software interrupt 0x15, subfunction 0x85 [2]  – was added to signal the  OS  when SysRq was pushed or released. Unlike most keys, when it is pressed nothing is stored in the  keyboard buffer .
