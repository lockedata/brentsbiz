					Woodland creature story sizing in practice

				     Today was my last day in Oslo, a chance to reflect on NDC and spend some time with the people I met. I had the pleasure of spending my last day with @toddhgardner, @mgasca, @reverentgeek and @timgthomas. Somewhere between the Maritime museum and the Viking museum we got talking about estimating, velocity and feature sizing. 
 I mentioned that some time last year our team stopped estimating features in terms of hours or days, we started talking about woodland creatures instead… because things makes more sense that way.
