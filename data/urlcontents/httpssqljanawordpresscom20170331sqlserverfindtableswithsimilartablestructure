		 SQL Server – Find Tables With Similar Table Structure 
			 
		 Today, as I was working with a table and I needed to find the “archived” version of the table. Typically, the archive table would have a name with “Archive” suffixed to the actual table name. Since I could not find the archive table by just matching on the table name, I had to improvise. 
 I figured that other tables that are structurally similar to my table are likely candidates to be the Archive version of my table. By structurally similar, I mean that they have a lot of matching columns names. 
 This is how I decided to go about finding the archive version of the table:

 Get the count of matching column names
