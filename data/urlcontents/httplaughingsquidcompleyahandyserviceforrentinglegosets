 Pley  is a handy service for renting  LEGO  sets. Users simply add specific sets to a queue of those theyâ€™d like to rent and Pley ships them out at no additional cost. When users are done with their rented set, they return them to Pley and another set is sent out. Every piece is sanitized in a sterilization solution before being delivered.
