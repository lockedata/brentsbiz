		 Dynamic data masking is a SQL Server 2016 feature to mask sensitive data at the column level from non-privileged users. Hiding SSNs is a common example in the documentation. However, the  documentation  also gives the following warning: 
 The purpose of dynamic data masking is to limit exposure of sensitive data, preventing users who should not have access to the data from viewing it.
