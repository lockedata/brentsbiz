       The simplicity of consistent hashing is pretty mind-blowing. Here you have a
number of nodes in a cluster of databases, or in a cluster of web caches. How do
you figure out where the data for a particular key goes in that cluster? 

 You apply a hash function to the key. That's it?  Yeah, that's the whole deal of
consistent hashing. It's in the name, isn't it? 

 The same key will always return the same hash code (hopefully), so once you've
figured out how you spread out a range of keys across the nodes available, you
can always find the right no
