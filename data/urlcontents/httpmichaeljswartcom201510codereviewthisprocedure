	  Code Review This Procedure 
	 Filed under:  SQLServerPedia Syndication , Technical Articles  —  Michael J. Swart @ 10:28 am  

	 
		 Earlier this week we encountered a web-site outage caused by a database procedure.  I’m going to blog about that problem (in detail) in a post scheduled for next week . But before I publish that post, I want to know how subtle or obvious the problem was. It seems obvious to me now, but I have the benefit of hindsight. I wonder whether we could we have avoided this during the code review stage of development. 
 So before I publish the details, I invite you to do a code review of this procedure in the comment section.
