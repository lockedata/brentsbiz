 A well overdue feature introduced in Denali CTP 3 is that of the Try_Parse and Try_Convert functions. These are great for dealing with the something that’s frustrated SQL developers for years – data type conversions. 
 Let’s imagine a rather nasty case, a file with some values in it that once imported into SQL (as character data) looks something like this: 
 
 Ewww… that’s a mess. Let’s see if we can identify which of the values can be converted into a numeric data type. The function prior to Denali for that was ISNUMERIC. 
 SELECT ANumber, ISNUMERIC(ANumber)
