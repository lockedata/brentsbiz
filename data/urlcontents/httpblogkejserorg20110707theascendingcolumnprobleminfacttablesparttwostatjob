 In my  last post  I described a common problem with statistics in data warehouses. I also directed you to a trace flag that partially solves the problem. There is an issue with this trace flag: at the time of writing this blog, it does not work on partitioned tables. Considering that large tables tend to be partitioned, this could be an issue.
