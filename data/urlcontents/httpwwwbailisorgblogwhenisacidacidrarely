 When is "ACID" ACID? Rarely.

 tl;dr: ACID and NewSQL databases rarely provide true ACID guarantees
 by default, if they are supported at all. See  the
 table . 

 Many databases today differentiate themselves from their NoSQL
counterparts by claiming to support  “100%
ACID”  transactions or by  “guaranteeing
strong consistency (ACID).”  In reality, few of these
databases—including traditional “big iron” systems like
Oracle—provide formal ACID guarantees,  even when they claim to do so . 

 The textbook definition of ACID Isolation is  serializability 
(e.g.,  Architecture
of a Database System , Section 6.2), which states that the outcome
of executing a set of transactions should be equivalent to some serial
execution of those transactions. This means that each transaction gets
