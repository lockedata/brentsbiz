 Analytic Functions  
 Analytic functions compute an aggregate value based on a group of rows. They differ from aggregate functions in that they return multiple rows for each group. The group of rows is called a  window  and is defined by the  analytic_clause . For each row, a sliding window of rows is defined. The window determines the range of rows used to perform the calculations for the current row. Window sizes can be based on either a physical number of rows or a logical interval such as time. 
 Analytic functions are the last set of operations performed in a query except for the final  ORDER   BY  clause. All joins and all  WHERE ,  GROUP   BY , and  HAVING  clauses are completed before the analytic functions are processed. Therefore, analytic functions can appear only in the select list or  ORDER   BY  clause. 
 Analytic functions are commonly used to compute cumulative, moving, centered, and reporting aggregates.
