Crocker's Rules 
Declaring yourself to be operating by "Crocker's Rules"
means that other people are allowed to optimize their messages for information,

it's your fault.  Anyone is allowed to call you a moron and claim
to be doing you a favor.  (Which, in point of fact, they would be. 
One of the big problems with this culture is that everyone's afraid to
tell you you're wrong, or they think they have to dance around it.) 
Two people using Crocker's Rules should be able to communicate all relevant
