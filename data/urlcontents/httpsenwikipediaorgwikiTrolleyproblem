The trolley problem: should you pull the lever to divert the runaway trolley onto the side track? 
 
 
 The  trolley problem  is a  thought experiment  in  ethics . The general form of the problem is this: 
 
 There is a runaway  trolley  barrelling down the  railway tracks . Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person tied up on the side track. You have two options: 
 Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track. 
 Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.
