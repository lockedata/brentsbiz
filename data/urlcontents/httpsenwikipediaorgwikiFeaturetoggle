				 A  feature toggle [1]  (also  feature switch ,  feature flag ,  feature flipper ,  conditional feature , etc.) is a technique in  software development  that attempts to provide an alternative to maintaining multiple  source-code  branches (known as feature branches), such that a feature can be tested even before it is completed and ready for release. Feature toggle is used to hide, enable or disable the feature during run time. For example, during the development process, a developer can enable the feature for testing and disable it for other users. [2] 
 Continuous release and  continuous deployment  provide developers with rapid feedback about their coding. This requires the integration of their code changes as early as possible. Feature branches introduce a bypass to this process. [3]  Feature togg
