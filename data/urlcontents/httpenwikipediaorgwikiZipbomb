 A  zip bomb , also known as a  zip of death  or  decompression bomb , is a malicious  archive file  designed to crash or render useless the program or system reading it. It is often employed to disable  antivirus software , in order to create an opening for more traditional viruses. 
 Rather than hijacking the normal operation of the program, a  zip  bomb allows the program to work as intended, but the archive is carefully crafted so that unpacking it (e.g. by a virus scanner in order to scan for viruses) requires inordinate amounts of time, disk space or memory. 
 Most modern antivirus programs can detect whether a file is a zip bomb, to avoid unpacking it. [1]
