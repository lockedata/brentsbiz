		 Speaking at the Group ByÂ conference! 				 
			 2017-01-23 2017-02-01  /  Daniel Hutmacher 					 
	 
		 This past Friday, I had the great privilege of speaking at the on-line  Group By  conference. Group By is a community-driven conference where anyone can submit an abstract. Site visitors will then rate sessions as well as help you build and improve your abstract.
