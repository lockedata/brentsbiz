 In the late seventeenth century, before the development of the  planer  and the  milling machine , it was extremely difficult to machine straight, flat surfaces. For this reason, good  prismatic pairs  without  backlash  were not easy to make. During that era, much thought was given to the problem of attaining a  straight-line motion  as a part of the coupler curve of a  linkage  having only revolute connection. Probably the best-known result of this search is the  straight line mechanism  development by Watt for guiding the piston of early steam engines. Although it does not generate an exact straight lin
