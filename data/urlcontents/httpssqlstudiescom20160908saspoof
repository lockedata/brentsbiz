			 This is nothing new but it’s still a fun idea. 
 The problem: 
 The vendor app we just purchased (and are told we  must  keep) requires the sa password. 
 The vendor insists that sa is hard coded into the app and can’t possibly be changed. 
 The sa account is the built in super user for SQL Server and we certainly aren’t going to give it to an application. 
 This might even be a shared server where giving one application sa means a security risk for all of the other app
