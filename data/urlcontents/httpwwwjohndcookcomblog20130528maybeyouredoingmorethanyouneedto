What is the last digit of  a * b ? What is the median digit of  a * b ? In both questions it is  conceptually  necessary to compute  a * b , but not  logically  necessary. Both are a question about  a * b , so computing the product is conceptually necessary. But there is no logical necessity to actually compute  a * b  in order to answer a question about it. In the first question, there’s an obvious short cut: multiply the last two digits and see that the last digit of the product must be 1. In the second question, it is conceivable that there is some way to find the median digit that is less work than com
