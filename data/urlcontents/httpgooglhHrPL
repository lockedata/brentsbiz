      Transitioning a mixed-mode vehicle to autonomous mode
 Abstract 
         Disclosed are methods and devices for transitioning a mixed-mode
     autonomous vehicle from a human driven mode to an autonomously driven
     mode. Transitioning may include stopping a vehicle on a predefined
     landing strip and detecting a reference indicator. Based on the reference
     indicator, the vehicle may be able to know its exact position.
     Additionally, the vehicle may use the reference indictor to obtain an
     autonomous vehicle instruction via a URL. After the vehicle knows its
     precise location and has an autonomous vehicle instruction, it can
     operate in autonomous mode.
