		 SQL Server Last date / time a password was changed I don't know why, but this simple request for SOX Compliance took me a while to find.  There is a function that retrieves login properties, LOGINPROPERTY, duh!  Of interest is the PasswordLastSetTime.  It also has many other useful properties, see:  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms345412(v=SQL.100).aspx .  It now becomes very easy to drop into any query, below is one of many sox queries we run that is now required to include this: 
SELECT --l.sid,
loginname AS [Login Name], 
loginproperty(loginname,'PasswordLastSetTime') as PasswordLastSetTime,
 dbname AS [Default Database],
CASE isntname 
 WHEN 1 THEN 'AD Login'
ELSE 'SQL Login'
END AS [Login_Type
