				 In  theoretical computer science , the  CAP theorem , also named  Brewer's theorem  after computer scientist  Eric Brewer , states that it is impossible for a  distributed data store  to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees: [1] [2] [3] 
 Consistency 
 Availability 
 Partition tolerance 
 Every read receives the most recent write or an error 
 Every request receives a (non-error) response â€“ without guarantee that it contains the most recent write 
 The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes 
 In other words, the CAP theorem states that in the presence of a network partition, one has to choose between consistency and availability. Note that consistency as defined in the CAP theorem is qu
