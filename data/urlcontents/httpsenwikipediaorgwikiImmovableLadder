 The  Immovable Ladder  ( Hebrew :  סולם הסטטוס קוו ‎,  lit.  "The status quo ladder") ( [1] Arabic :  السُّلَّم الثَّابِت ‎,  lit.  "The stationary ladder" [1] [2] ) is a wooden  ladder  located above the facade, under the window of the  Church of the Holy Sepulchre  in the  Old City  of  Jerusalem . Made of  cedar wood , possibly from  Lebanon , it was first mentioned in 1757 and has remained in that location since the 18th century, aside from being temporarily moved on two occasions. The ladder is referred to as "immovable" due to an understanding that no cleric of the six ecumenical Christian orders may move, rearrange,
