One of Instapaper’s five leased servers was hosted at DigitalOne, a Swiss hosting company leasing blade servers from a Virginia datacenter. Early Tuesday morning, the FBI raided the datacenter to seize servers used by another DigitalOne customer for fraudulent “scareware” distribution, according to  the FBI’s press release , but they seemingly took a lot more servers that happened to be physically near the server(s) they were looking for. There’s  very  little information on this, but The New York Times has the most complete coverage in  Tuesday’s Bits post : The F.B.I. seized Web servers in a raid on a data center early Tuesday, causing several Web sites, including those run by the New York publisher Curbed Network, to go offline.
