April 20, 2012 When I didn’t have any experience, I thought that experience was totally worthless. Emmett and I taught ourselves how to build web applications in a few months in college and built the first version of Kiko pretty quickly. I did the front end by piecing together javascript tutorials until we had something that resembled a calendar. We thought we were pretty awesome. If we could build a web app that easily and drum up a bunch of public interest, then it seemed to us that everyone should be starting startups right out of college, and that anyone who wasn’t was just too scared. What was the point of waiting? You aren’t getting any younger. When I think about that first codebase today I want to vomit in my own mouth.
