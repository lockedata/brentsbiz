 Last year I blogged about how I got the MCT Certification for 4th consecutive year  and more importantly – how I started to see a change in the program that would make it matter again. This year, however, I decided to not go for it because nothing actually changed even though there were some signs. This would have been my 5th year as a MCT, but no, it just does not make sense for me. Let me explain. 
 What does the MCT Certification give you except for a bit of swag? 
 Access to Office 365 – I have such as a  Microsoft MVP . 
 Access to some MCT Forums – I have never ever seen a reason to spend time there
