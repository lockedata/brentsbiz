						 THIS TOPIC APPLIES TO:   SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Data Warehouse  Parallel Data Warehouse    Use the  lightweight pooling  option to provide a means of reducing the system overhead associated with the excessive context switching sometimes seen in symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) environments. When excessive context switching is present, lightweight pooling can provide better throughput by performing the context switching inline, thus helping to reduce user/kernel ring transitions.   
  Fiber mode is intended for certain situations in which the context switching of the UMS workers are the critical bottleneck in performance. Because this is rare, fiber mode
