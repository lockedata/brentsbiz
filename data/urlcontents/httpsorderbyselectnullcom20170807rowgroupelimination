		 Rowgroup elimination is a performance optimization based on compressed rowgroup metadata that can allow rowgroups to be skipped during query execution. It’s likely that all of the metadata used for the optimization is exposed in the  sys.column_store_segments  DMV. This blog post explores some of the less well known rules and limitations for rowgroup elimination. 
 Test Data 
 To keep things very simple we’ll build 100 rowgroups with exactly 1 million rows in each of them.  ID  and  ID2  increase from 1 to 10000000 and  ID_NULL  is always NULL. Code to create and populate the table: 
 
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dbo.MILLIONAIRE_CCI;

CREATE TABLE dbo.MILLIONAIRE_CCI (
	ID BIGINT NULL,
	ID2 BIGINT NULL,
	ID_NULL B
