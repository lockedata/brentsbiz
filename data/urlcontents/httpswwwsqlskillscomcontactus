 Thank you for your interest in our services and training! 
 We don’t publish a phone number as we’re usually working with clients or away from the office teaching. 
 The best way to contact us initially is by email; that way we have your contact information and can easily get back to you within a business day to set up a time for an introductory call. 
 Just click on one of the links below and let us know how we can help you: 
 Questions about Training  (public classes, private classes, online courses) 
 Questions about Consulting  (health checks, performance, remote DBA, …) 
 We sincerely look forward to helping you! 
 Paul, Kimberly, and the SQLskills team
