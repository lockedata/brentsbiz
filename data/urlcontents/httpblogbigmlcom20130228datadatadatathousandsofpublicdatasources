								 We love data, big and small and we are always on the lookout for  interesting datasets . Over the last two years, the  BigML team  has compiled  a long list of sources of data  that anyone can use. It’s a great list for browsing, importing into  our platform , creating new models and just exploring what can be done with different sets of data. 
 In this post, we are sharing this list with you.
