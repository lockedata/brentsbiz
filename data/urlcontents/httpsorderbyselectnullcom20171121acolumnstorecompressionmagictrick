		 Columnstore compression is complicated, and in some cases, surprising. 
 The Setup 
 The source data for the CCI has enough rows to fit six perfect rowgroups. The  ID  column is just sequential integers from 1 to 6291456. The  ID2  column is the  ID  column modulo 20001. Code to load the data into a temp table: 
   
 &lt;span 				data-mce-type="bookmark" 				id="mce_SELREST_end" 				data-mce-style="overflow:hidden;line-height:0" 				style="overflow:hidden;line-height:0" 			&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #STG_DATA;
CREATE TABLE #STG_DATA (
	ID BIGINT NOT NULL,
	ID2 BIGINT NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

INSERT INTO #STG_DATA WITH (TABLOCK)
SELECT t.RN, t.RN %
