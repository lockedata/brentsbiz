What’s surprising is not how quickly the facts on the ground change, but how slowly engineering practice changes in response. This is a Strowger switch, an automated way to connect phone circuits. It was invented in 1891. 
 
 In 1951, right on the cusp of digital switching, the typical central switching office was basically a super-sized version of the Victorian technology. There was a strowger s
