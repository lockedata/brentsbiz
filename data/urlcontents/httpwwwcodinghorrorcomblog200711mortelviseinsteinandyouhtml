 Mort, Elvis, Einstein, and You 
 Earlier this week I wrote about  The Two Types of Programmers . Based on the huge number of comments, it seemed to strike a nerve. Or two. This surprised me, because it was never meant to be the inflammatory, provocative diatribe that many people interpreted it as. It got so out of hand that Ben Collins-Sussman, the original author of the post I quoted, was  driven to post a followup clarifying his original post . 
 Many of the commenters were offended that I somehow lumped them into a vast unwashed eighty-percent sea of vocational programmers. Here's what's particularly ironic:  the very act of commenting on an article about software development automatically means you're  not  a vocational eighty-percenter . Trust me. I absolutely  was not calling any of my readers inadequate . I don't say that because I'm a world class suckup; my blog isn't so
