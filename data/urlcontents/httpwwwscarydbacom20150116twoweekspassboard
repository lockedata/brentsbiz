		 The one absolute promise I made about serving on the PASS Board is that I would let you know what I was doing there. Well, we’re two weeks in and I figured now was a good time for a report. 
 Next week is my first board meeting (and I will report back on how that goes). I’ll be presenting the goals I’ve worked up for the Chapters and see how many of them we can get approved and then how many of them we can deliver. 
 In the time I’ve had on the board so far, a big part of what I’ve been doing is learning about what has gone before. What kind of goals did we have for last year.
