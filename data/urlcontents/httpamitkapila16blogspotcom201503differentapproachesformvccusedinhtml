Different Approaches for MVCC used in well known Databases
 
 
 
 
 
 
Database Management Systems uses MVCC to avoid the problem of 
Writers blocking Readers and vice-versa, by making use of multiple 
versions of data. 
There are essentially two approaches to multi-version concurrency. Approaches for MVCC 
The first approach is to store multiple versions of records in the 
database, and garbage collect records when they are no longer 
required. This is the approach adopted by Postgr
