 In a fit of “open source your interview process”, I tweeted yesterday
with the list of questions I’m drawing from when interviewing. A lot
of people
 responded in the gist  with
amazing suggestions, and I thought I’d consolidate them here so they
don’t get lost in my pile of gists. 
 My basic strategy is to spend 20 minutes before each interview I do
and pick some appropriate questions from this list. I’ve tried to
categorize them a bit. A lot of these are outright stolen from
 Edward O’Campo-Gooding’s list of questions ,
as well as from various people at
 Hacker School . I’d love suggestions for
more! 
 Special thanks to  @bmastenbrook ,

suggestions.
