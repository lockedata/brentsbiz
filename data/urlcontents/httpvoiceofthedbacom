							 Catch up on SQL in the City 2018–GDPR Edition 			
			 
									 Posted on   March 8, 2018 					 by   way0utwest   							 

				 
				 The videos for our SQL in the City 2018 broadcast from last month are up on the Redgate channel in a  playlist . If you missed anything or would like to rewatch something, you can do it.  
 If you’ve got questions or comments, we’d love to hear from you.
