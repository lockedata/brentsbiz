I won’t name names, so we’ll call her Jane. Jane’s five closest friends are two engineers at Google, an engineer at Eventbrite, an architect, and her father (which is so cute), who is the president of a national soccer team in Jane’s home country. Jane graduated with a degree in Business Administration.  That was a mistake.  BizAdmin in San Francisco basically means she takes other people’s work and tries to find a use for it. When Jane moved to California, it was 2008.  The economy wasn’t on her side.  What little she chance she had at getting a job as a recent grad was thwarted by the flood of mid to higher range vets coming into the job market.  So Jane did what she had to in order to make ends meet; she got a job at CVS working as a pharmacy technician.   Jane spent the next year applying for jobs in her field.
