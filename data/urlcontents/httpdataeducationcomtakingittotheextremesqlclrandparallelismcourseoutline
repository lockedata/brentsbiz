 SQL Server Training It’s no accident that Adam Machanic named his company Data Education. Adam is passionate about getting the very best out of SQL Server, and he loves teaching others how to do the same. A seasoned presenter and trainer, he has been invited to deliver breakout sessions and full-day workshops across North America and Europe. If you are unable to catch Adam at a public event, or want a more targeted and personalized experience, we are happy to arrange for private on-site training. Typical training engagements are 1 to 3 days of in-depth classroom-style teaching. Please get in touch to discuss particulars as our private training is always highly customized to your company’s individual needs
