     Iconic Patent Art 
   

   
     
   

   
     

   Old patents are beautiful. And they make gorgeous free art for the office. 

   A few weeks ago we remastered eight iconic patents, printed them onto A3 paper and framed them in
     Ikea RIBBA frames . The total cost was around $8 each and they look great 	on the office wall.
   
   
     Google Patents  is a treasure trove, but the images are too low resolution for a good print. We've made the high resolution versions available below for you to download.
