Carlos Gozzi, a 18th-century Italian playwright, thought there were 36 dramatic situations, but ever since then, the number has been going down, cratering with Christopher Booker's popular 2004  The Seven Basic Plot Structures.  But now, with the help of CERN-level mathematics and computers, researchers have evidence that the appropriately named Booker was off by just one, probably.  "I did some distance similarity metric calculations and machine clustering to see if I could identify archetypal plot shapes," Matthew Jockers told me over the phone.
