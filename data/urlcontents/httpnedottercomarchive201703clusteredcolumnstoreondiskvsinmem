 The first thing to note – which is not specific to columnstore for either type of table – is that Microsoft chose a really poor name for this type of index.   
 Why do I say that?   
 For the following reasons:   
 1. Traditional/regular clustered indexes physically sort data, but data within a columnstore index is unordered (that’s true for clustered and nonclustered columnstore indexes).   
 2. For a traditional/regular clustered index, the key columns are added to all nonclustered indexes. Columnstore indexes don’t have a “key” so nothing about
