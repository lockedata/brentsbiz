			 The Missing Piece of SQL Conferences 
		 
	 
 
	 Recently Steve Jones ( b | t ) has been writing a series of posts around the Pass Summit and SQL Saturdays. The one posted on July 5th on  Choosing Content for the Summit  got me thinking about content, not just at the Summit, but also at other various SQL conferences and events. 
 I had a conversation around the subject of content at  Summit  (picking on the PASS Summit here as it’s the most visible, however this pertains to SQL Saturday’s, and many other events) with Joey D’Antoni ( b | t ) and we identified, what we believe to be, missed opportunities.
