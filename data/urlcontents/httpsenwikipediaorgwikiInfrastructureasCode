				 Infrastructure as code  (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer  data centers  through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. [1]  The  IT infrastructure  meant by this comprises both physical equipment such as  bare-metal servers  as well as  virtual machines  and associated configuration resources. The definitions may be in a  version control system . It can use either scripts or declarative definitions, rather than manual processes, but the term is more often used to promote declarative approaches. 
 Infrastructure as code approaches are promoted for  cloud computing , which is sometimes marketed as  infrastructure as a service  (IaaS). IaC supports IaaS, but should not be confused with it
