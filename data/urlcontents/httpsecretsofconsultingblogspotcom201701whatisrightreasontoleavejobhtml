 What is the right reason to leave a job? 
 
 
 
 
 As a consultant, I frequently leave jobs. I also help many people decide whether or not to leave their jobs. I have learned there is no one "right" reason for leaving, but I've accumulated a list of many "good" reasons for leaving. I'll give some examples: 
 
 
 
 In my career, I have left jobs whenÂ  
 
 
 
 - the job I was hired to do was finished. 
 
 
 
 - the job I was hired to do could not be finished. 
 
 
 
 - the job I was hired to do would be finished just fine without me. 
 
 
 
 - I was not able to do the job I was hired to do. 
 
 
 
 - the job I was hired to do wasn't worth doing. 
 
 
 
 - I was no longer learning new things (that's my most frequent reason for leaving)
