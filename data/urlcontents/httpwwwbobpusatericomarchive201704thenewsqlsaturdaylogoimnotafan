 At last month’s  SQL Saturday in Chicago , we had two great distinctions: 
 We were SQL Saturday #600, a milestone! (But weren’t SQL Saturday numbers  going away? ) 
 We also were the first SQL Saturday to use the new logo, which is just one part of the major rebranding project undertaken by PASS last year. 
 At PASS Summit 2016, PASS announced several new logos as part of it’s  rebranding  campaign. There were new logos for PASS as a whole, SQL Saturday, 24 Hours of PASS, PASS Summit, and Business Analytics. In general they’re not terrible. I actually really like the new PASS logo. The old one just never made sense to me. Wa
