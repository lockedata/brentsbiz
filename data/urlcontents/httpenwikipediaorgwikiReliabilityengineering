				 Reliability engineering  is a sub-discipline of  systems engineering  that emphasizes  dependability  in the  lifecycle management  of a  product . Dependability, or reliability, describes the ability of a system or component to function under stated conditions for a specified period of time. [1]  Reliability is closely related to  availability , which is typically described as the ability of a component or system to function at a specified moment or interval of time. 
 Reliability  is theoretically defined as the  probability  of success  ( Reliability = 1 âˆ’ Probability of Failure ) ; {\displaystyle ({\text{Reliability}}=1-{\text{Probability of Failure}});}  as the frequency of failures; or in terms of  availability , as a probability derived from reliability, testability and mainta
