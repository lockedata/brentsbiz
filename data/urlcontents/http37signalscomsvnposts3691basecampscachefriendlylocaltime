   An important ingredient in the  caching to the max  recipe is sharing caches between users. When cache keys are free of user-specific attributes, requests are far more likely to hit a warm cache and remain snappy. 


	 This cache sharing constraint means we can’t render local times. If we did, the time would be cached correctly for the first viewer and incorrectly for everyone in a different time z
