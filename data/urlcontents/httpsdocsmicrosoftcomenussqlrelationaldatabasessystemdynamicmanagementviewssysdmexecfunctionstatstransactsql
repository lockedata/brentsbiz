						 THIS TOPIC APPLIES TO:   SQL Server (starting with 2016) Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Data Warehouse  Parallel Data Warehouse    Returns aggregate performance statistics for cached functions. The view returns one row for each cached function plan, and the lifetime of the row is as long as the function remains cached. When a  function is removed from the cache, the corresponding row is eliminated from this view. At that time, a Performance Statistics SQL trace event is raised similar to  sys.dm_exec_query_stats . Returns information about scalar functions, including in-memory functions and CLR scalar functions. Does not return information about table valued functions.
