We want to make GitLab.com fast and we  knew it was time to leave the cloud  and purchase our own servers. In this post is our thinking about what chassis, rack, memory, CPU, network, power, and hosting to buy. We wanted to share what we learned and get your feedback on our proposal and questions. When you reply to a question in the comments on our blog or Hacker News please reference it with the letter and number: 'Regarding R1'. We'll try to update the questions with preliminary answers as we learn more.
