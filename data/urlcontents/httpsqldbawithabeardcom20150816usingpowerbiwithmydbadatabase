 Using Power Bi with my DBA Database

		 Every good DBA should have a DBA database. A place to store information about all of their instances and databases. 
 I have an InstanceList table which looks like this 
 
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[InstanceList](
[InstanceID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
[ServerName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
[InstanceName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
[Port] [int] NOT NULL,
[AG] [bit] NULL,
[Inactive] [bit] NULL
