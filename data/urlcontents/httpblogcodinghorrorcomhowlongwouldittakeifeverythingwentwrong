 How Long Would It Take if Everything Went Wrong? 
 
I'm currently reading Steve McConnell's new book,  Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art . The section on individual expert judgment provided one simple reason why my estimates are often so horribly wrong:
 
 
If you ask a developer to estimate a set of features, the developer will often come back with an estimate that looks like this:
 
 Feature Estimated Days 
 Alpha 1.5
 Bravo 1.5
 Charlie 2.0
 Delta 0.5
 Echo 0.5
 Foxtrot 0.25
 Golf 2.0
 Hotel 1.0
 India 0.75
 Juliet 1.25
 Total 11.25 
 
If you then ask the same developer to reestimate each feature's best case and worst case, the developer will often return with estimates similar to these:
 
 Feature Best Case (days) Worst Case (days) 
 Alpha 1.25 2.0
 Bravo 1.5 2.5
 Charlie 2.0 3.0
 Delta 0.75 2.0
 Echo 0.5 1.25
 Foxtrot 0.25 0.5
 Golf 1.5 2.5
