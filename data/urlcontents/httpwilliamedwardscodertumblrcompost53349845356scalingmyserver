       About 
      Always loved programming - its like Lego without gravity.  Basic on my ZX81 graduating to assembler and Turbo Pascal during my teens.  Developed phone OS software - engineer, architect, product manager - but got made irrelevant by the iPhone and redundant by Android.  These days, I mostly just code again
