Note:  Special symbols in this file that are outside the Latin-1 character
set (ISO 8859-1) are represented by a .gif image for each character.
The alt tag for each image gives the name of the character.  Students
who are just learning the symbols can move the mouse to any symbol
to get a brief reminder of its name.
