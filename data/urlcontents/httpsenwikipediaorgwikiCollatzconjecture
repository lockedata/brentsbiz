 Unsolved problem in mathematics : Does the Collatz sequence eventually reach 1 for all positive integer initial values? (more unsolved problems in mathematics) 
 
 The  Collatz conjecture  is a  conjecture  in  mathematics  that concerns a  sequence  defined as follows: start with any  positive integer   n . Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. Otherwise, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of  n , the sequence will always reach 1. 
 The conjecture is named after  Lothar Collatz , who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate. [1]  It is also known as the  3 n  + 1 conjecture , the  Ulam conjecture  (after  S
