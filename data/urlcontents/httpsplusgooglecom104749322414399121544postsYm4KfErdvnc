And because you’re both in a Hangout, you can talk with and see each other during the session. To get started, just start a Hangout and click View More Apps &gt; Add Apps &gt; Hangouts Remote Desktop.  Let us know what you think, and please keep the feedback coming! #googleplusupdate ‹ › 3 Photos - View album  79 comments  79   990 plus ones
