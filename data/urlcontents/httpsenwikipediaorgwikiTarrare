 Tarrare  (c. 1772 – 1798), sometimes spelled  Tarare , was a French showman and soldier, noted for his unusual eating habits. Able to eat vast amounts of meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him, and he was turned out of the family home as a teenager. He travelled France in the company of a band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling  charlatan ; he would swallow corks, stones, live animals and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to  Paris  where he worked as a street performer.
