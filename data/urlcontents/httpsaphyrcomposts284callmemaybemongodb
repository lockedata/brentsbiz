       Previously in  Jepsen , we discussed  Redis . In this post, we’ll see MongoDB drop a phenomenal amount of data. See also: followup analyses of  2.6.7  and  3.4.0-rc3 . 

 MongoDB is a document-oriented database with a similar distribution design to Redis. In a replica set, there exists a single writable primary node which accepts writes, and asynchronously replicates those writes as an  oplog  to N secondaries. However, there are a few key differences. 

 First, Mongo builds in its leader election and replicated state machine. There’s no separate system which tries to observe a replica set in order to make decisions about what it should do. The replica set decides among itself which node should
